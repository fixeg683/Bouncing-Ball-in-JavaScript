A physics simulation including a ball’s vertical and horizontal movement, gravity influence, and energy losses on bounces from walls. The simulation involves user interaction with ball movements to make the program game-like (jumping, ac/deceleration of sideways movement).

JavaScript introduced: 	variables, if/else statements, or operators, functions, global/public/ private declarations, concept of an object.

Abstractions explained: gravity force influence on objects, energy loss on bounces, mathematical infinite ground bounce problem vs real life.

Controls: 	
- W – jump
- A – increase the ball’s speed towards left
- D – increase the ball’s speed towards right
